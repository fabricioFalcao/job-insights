# Job Data Analysis Project

In this project, I implemented data analysis tasks using Python with the dataset extracted from Glassdoor via Kaggle. The goal was to leverage various Python functionalities to explore, process, and analyze job-related data.

## Skills Developed

- Utilizing the Python interactive terminal.
- Implementing conditional and loop structures.
- Using built-in functions for data manipulation.
- Implementing exception handling for error management.
- Manipulating files for data input/output.
- Writing custom functions for data processing.
- Writing and executing tests using Pytest.
- Creating custom modules and importing them in other scripts.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis tasks.
- **Terminal**: Leveraged for interactive Python sessions and script execution.
- **Conditional and Loop Structures**: Implemented for data processing logic.
- **Built-in Functions**: Utilized for efficient data manipulation and transformation.
- **Exception Handling**: Managed unexpected errors during data analysis.
- **File Handling**: Read, write, and manage datasets using file operations.
- **Functions**: Implemented custom functions for reusable data processing tasks.
- **Pytest**: Used for writing and executing test cases to validate data manipulation functions.
- **Module Creation and Importing**: Developed custom modules for encapsulating specific functionalities.

## Project Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gained insights and identified patterns through data exploration.
- **Data Manipulation Functions**: Cleaned, transformed, and preprocessed datasets for analysis.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensured reliability of data manipulation functions through comprehensive unit testing.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized code into reusable modules for better maintainability.

This project provided valuable experience in applying Python programming and data analysis skills to real-world datasets, improving proficiency in fundamental programming concepts and data manipulation techniques.
